### 1D Magnetohydrodynamics

This is a 1-dimensional MHD plasma model built as a final project for MATH 6640 Introduction to Numerical Methods for PDEs at Georgia Tech. A PDF of my project writeup is included in the repository.

I have continued building on the code as a toy model since submitting the project, to develop my understanding and become more familiar with Julia. Primarily, I implemented the adaptive time step described in the paper the program is based on:
